BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL).  BAO currently has over 1000 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies.  It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design,  Detection Technology, and Endpoint.  Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen).  Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation).  Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof.  The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal.  Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal.  Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc.).  BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays.  All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.",

In order to bridge the gap between the overflow of HTS data and the bottleneck of integrated analysis tools, herein, we provide the first comprehensive GPCR ontology. The development and utility of GPCR ontology was based on previously developed BioAssay Ontology (BAO). The GPCR ontology contains information about biochemical, pharmacological, and functional properties of individual GPCRs as well as GPCR-selective ligands inclusive of their HTS screening results and other records. This provides the first all-inclusive GPCR ontology with all available data to model the relationship between the GPCR binding sites and their physiologic and pharmacologic role in physiology via small molecule chemical structures. We developed this system using emerging semantic technologies, by leveraging existing and descriptive domain level ontologies.",

In this backdrop, we have developed a comprehensive ontology on primary and established cell lines-both normal and pathologic. It covers around 400 cell lines. This ontology has been built to include the major domains in the field of biology like anatomy, bio-molecules, chemicals and drugs, pathological conditions and genetic variations around the cell lines. An extensive network of relations has been built across these concepts to enable different combinations of queries. The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC, DSMZ, ECACC, ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.",

Additionally, in order to permit the treatment of a set of objects as a single entity, this high-level ontology considers the concept of List (P:00004) and more specifically an Aggregate (P:00005), containing a set of Data or Entry, respectively.\r\nThe concept Intermediate is an Entry, allowing for the successive application of an operation to an Element.

The five nodes of the ontology are: classic metabolic, regulatory, signaling, drug and disease pathways. An extensive survey of the review literature along with searches of existing pathway databases have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. The ontology is continually expanding along with the development of Pathway and Disease Portals at RGD. Mapping of pathways in other databases to terms in PW as synonyms further increased the content of the ontology. It also provided the means to bring in annotations made by these databases and link to their sites via automatic pipelines built at RGD. The ontology allows for the standardized annotation of rat as well as human and mouse genes to pathway terms. It also serves as a vehicle to connect between genes and ontology reports, between reports and interactive pathway diagrams, between pathways that directly connect to one another within a diagram or between pathways that in some fashion are globally related in pathway suites and suite networks. Metabolic, regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway, if known. Both the provision of terms for the altered versions of pathways and the representation of disease pathway diagrams as a collection of altered pathways are unique to the PW ontology and RGD's pathway data.\r\nThe Pathway ontology is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license version 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0), see\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0 for details.

The major achievements of MENELAS are the realisation of its two functional systems: (i) The Document Indexing System encodes free text PDSs into both an internal representation (a set of Conceptual Graphs) and international nomenclature codes (ICD-9-CM). Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes.\r\nThis ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).
