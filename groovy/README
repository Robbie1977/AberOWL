== Groovy Aber OWL ==

Groovy Aber OWL is a testing alternative implementation of AberOWL in Groovy. Right now, it kinda works. Remember to build the Java project before running this, since it uses some of these classes.

Ontology repo test code runs with:

```
groovy -cp ../Libraries/commons-io-2.4.jar RemoteOntologyManager.groovy
```

Currently, you can run the hosted AberOWL with the following:

```
groovy -cp ../Libraries/owlapi-distribution-3.4.10.jar:../Libraries/elk-distribution-0.4.1-owlapi-library/elk-owlapi.jar:../dist/SparqOwlAPI.jar AberOWLServer.groovy
```
